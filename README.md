# EM-algorithm-for-Noisy-OR
implement an Expectation Maximization algorithm to estimate noisy-or parameters of P which is vector of n probabilities.
Note that at each observation, here X is vector of n Random variables with Xi ∈ {0,1}, Z is vector of n Random variables 
with Zi ∈ {0,1}, and Y is binary random variable Y ∈ {0,1}
